# Exercise 01: Creating a Fabric Workspace and Eventhouse for Real-Time Intelligence

### Estimated duration: 30 Minutes

In this exercise, you will explore **Real-Time Intelligence** to gain insights from streaming data and create a **Fabric Workspace** to organize and collaborate on your projects. You will also set up an **Eventhouse** to efficiently store and analyze event-driven data, enabling **OneLake Availability** for seamless data integration.

## Lab Objectives: 
In this lab, you will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Experience Real-Time Intelligence
- Task 2: Create a Fabric Workspace
- Task 3: Create an Eventhouse
- Task 4. Enable OneLake Availability

### Task 1: Experience Real-Time Intelligence  
In this task, you will explore Real-Time Intelligence and its categories, gaining an understanding of its various components and functionalities.

1. Select the **Workloads** icon on the left of your screen. A dialog with the list of Fabric experiences will open. The list of experiences includes Power BI, Data Factory, Industry Solutions, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Data Warehouse. Let’s explore.

1. Click on the **Real-Time Intelligence** experience under **Workloads**.

1. You will be navigated to the **Real-Time Intelligence Home page**. You will see **Item types** under the **About**, and **Get started** categories. Within the **Item type** category, notice the items:

    a. **Eventhouse:** Used to create a workspace of one or multiple KQL database(s) and share across projects. It also creates a KQL Database within the Eventhouse.
    
    b. **KQL** **Queryset:** Used to run queries on the data to produce shareable tables and visuals.
    
    c. **Real-Time Dashboard**: A collection of tiles, optionally organized in pages, where each tile has an underlying query and a visual representation.
    
    d. **Eventstream:** Used to capture, transform, and route real-time eventstream.
    
    e. **Activator:** To initiate automated actions when patterns or conditions are detected in changing data.

### Task 2: Create a Fabric Workspace

In this task, you will create a workspace to begin working with Real-Time Intelligence.

1. Now, let’s create a workspace with a Fabric license. Select **Workspaces (1)** from the navigation bar on the left.

1. Select  **+ New workspace (2)**.

1. The **Create a workspace** dialog opens on the right side of the browser.

1. In the **Name** field, enter **RTI_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject>** (1). 

   >**Note**: Each user's ID will be unique, and the workspace name must also be unique. Ensure a green check mark with **"This name is available"** appears below the Name field.

1. If you would like, you can enter a **Description** of the workspace. This is an optional field.

1. Click on **Advanced (2)** to expand the section.

1. Under **License mode**, ensure that **Trial (1)** is selected (it should be the default option), then click **Apply (2)** to create a new workspace.

    >**Note:** If the **Introducing task flows** dialog opens, click **Got it**.

### Task 3: Create an Eventhouse
In this task, you will create an Eventhouse, which is used to store, process, and analyze real-time streaming data efficiently within Microsoft Fabric.

1. Click the **+ New item** box to open a new pane with all the items you can create in this Fabric workspace.

    ![](media/new_item.png)

1. Search for **Eventhouse (1)** and select the **Eventhouse (2)** option from *Store data*. As we have discussed, this can be viewed similarly to a Lakehouse in that we can store data, but this Eventhouse is focused on real-time data.

    ![](media/eventhouse-1.png)

1. In the window that appears, give your Eventhouse the name **WebEvents_EH (1)** and click **Create (2)**.

    ![](media/image32.png)

1. The Eventhouse efficiently handles real-time data streams, enabling organizations to ingest, process, and analyze data in near real-time. It is optimized for time-based streaming events, automatically indexing and partitioning data based on ingestion time.

### Task 4. Enable OneLake Availability
In this task, you will enable OneLake Availability to automatically copy KQL Database data to OneLake in Delta format, allowing seamless querying through Lakehouse and other tools. It’s best enabled before loading large datasets and can be set per table.

1. When an Eventhouse is created, a KQL Database with the same name is created as well. To open the KQL Database, click on the Database **WebEvents_EH** in the **KQL Databases** section.

    ![](media/image_task04_step01.png)

2. After selecting the KQL Database, click on the **switch availability** to enable the OneLake availability, as shown in the screenshot.

    ![](media/image_task04_step02.png)

    >**Note:** Newly created tables will automatically inherit the "OneLake availability" setting from the Database level

3. Now, the dialog "Enable OneLake availability" is shown. Ensure that "Apply to existing tables" is checked and click **enable**.
